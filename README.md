# The-Book-of-Ani
Game for the JS13kgames contest
This is a game made for a coding competition in which the final project must fit all the content of the game in a 13kb zip package, and 1 month for creation after the theme anouncement. .
The game is complete, thought I wish that some minor things would be better polished, like the foot animation, more sprites, sound effects for collisions and the last stage.
